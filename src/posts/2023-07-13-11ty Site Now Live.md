I finally got around to deploying this site on netlify.

I'm hoping to move everything over in the future and use this site as my main blogging site.

## Features

I used `eleventy-base-blog` as a start which has a large number of features already.

<i class="fa fa-link"></i> <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty/eleventy-base-blog - Github</a>

I have added:

- [x] postcss integration
- [x] esbuild integration
- [x] automatic markdown image optimization
- [x] post feature image
- [x] image attribution link
- [x] post list pagination
- [x] darkmode support (`localStorage` & `prefers-color-scheme`)
- [x] opengraph meta tags
- [x] social media meta tags
- [x] markdown checklists
- [x] eslint with prettier
- [x] favicon generation

Info on how development has gone so far can be seen in blog post

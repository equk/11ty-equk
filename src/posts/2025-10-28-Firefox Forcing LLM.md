excerpt: "Mozilla forcing llm features and providing no gui for users to disable them"
---

Mozilla has been adding in llm & ai related features to Firefox for a while, enabling them by default without asking the user.

The main problem with this is users are having this forced on them with no gui option to disable these features.

In addition to having annoying unused options in context menus, dialog options & link previews users also have to contend with problems relating to high cpu usage draining battery power on laptops when navigating tabs.

[New local AI integration into Firefox spurs complaints of CPU going nuts](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/new-local-ai-integration-into-firefox-spurs-complaints-of-cpu-going-nuts-chip-and-power-spikes-plague-new-version-141-x)

This follows Mozilla changing the terms of service then revising those terms after huge criticism earlier this year.

[Mozilla is already revising its new Firefox terms to clarify how it handles user data](https://www.theverge.com/news/622080/mozilla-revising-firefox-terms-of-use-data)

Mozilla also [removed a question](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commit/d459addab846d8144b61939b7f4310eb80c5470e) about selling data suggesting they do now sell user data.

## Disable LLM

It doesn't seem there are many options relating to disabling ai features in the gui of firefox, they instead hide it behind config variables.

> [!note]
> I had `browser.ml.enable` & `browser.ml.chat.enable` set to `false` but still had a option in the context menu saying 'ask an ai chatbot (z)'.

This lead to me adding even more preferences into `prefs.js` on my profile scripts.

Here is a listing of options to disable llm & ai related features in firefox.

```js
user_pref("browser.ml.enable", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.hideFromLabs", true);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.hideLabsShortcuts", true);

user_pref("browser.ml.chat.page", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.page.footerBadge", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.page.menuBadge", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.menu", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.linkPreview.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.pageAssist.enabled", false);

user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.userEnable", false);

user_pref("extensions.ml.enabled", false);
```

You can set these in `about:config` or add them to `prefs.js` in your profile folder.

I have [automated scripts](#download) to add these settings to every profile on my system.

## Alternatives

There are a few projects that are forks of firefox with these features removed.

I would think most non technical users would just use a different browser.

Mozilla Firefox share of the browser market is already tiny.

### Browser Market Share Worldwide - September 2025

- Chrome: 71.77%
- Safari: 13.9%
- Edge: 4.67%
- Firefox: 2.17%

My firefox profile scripts are available on github with a default `prefs.js` included.

excerpt: "C program that sends the init code to initialize macro keys on Razer BlackWidow keyboards on Linux"
---

I decided to rewrite most of the code in this old project to make it easier to add devices.<br/>
I also replaced all the code relating to opening usb devices.

## Info

This is a C program that sends the init code to initialize the 'macro' keys on Razer BlackWidow keyboards on Linux.

Linux users can then use the macro keys on their keyboard.

## Changes

### Improvements

- [x] new code for opening usb devices
- [x] array of keyboard device IDs
- [x] new cli feedback
- [x] support for more keyboards

<br/>

### Updating libusb Code

I have been meaning to update the code to replace `libusb_open_device_with_vid_pid()`

> <code>libusb_open_device_with_vid_pid()</code><br/>
> This function is intended for those scenarios where you are using libusb to knock up a quick test application

#### New Handle Code

Use `libusb_get_device_list()` to check the device exists in the system before calling `libusb_open()` to open the connection.

> <code>libusb_get_device_list()</code><br/>
> Returns a list of USB devices currently attached to the system.<br/>
> This is your entry point into finding a USB device to operate.

> <code>libusb_open()</code><br/>
> Open a device and obtain a device handle.<br/>
> This is a non-blocking function; no requests are sent over the bus.

- [x] Get USB Device List
- [x] Check For Matching `venid` & `devid`
- [x] Open Handle On Match

### Adding More Devices

The old code was a mess when it came to this.

I changed the way this was implemented so it now uses an array of known devices.<br/>
This makes it a lot easier to add support for more keyboards.

| ID | Device Name |
|---|---|
| 010D | Razer BlackWidow Ultimate |
| 010E | Razer BlackWidow |
| 011B | Razer BlackWidow 2013 |
| 0203 | Razer BlackWidow Chroma |
| 0221 | Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2 |
| 011A | Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2014 |

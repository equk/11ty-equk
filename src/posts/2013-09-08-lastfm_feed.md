I just uploaded a new project to my github.

Some of the code is old but thought it would be worth uploading for other people to use.

![example_screenshot](../../src/_media/images/2013/09/lastfm_feed.png)

It's been relesed under the GPL v3 License.

```php
    *****************************************************************
                    Lastfm feed - equk.co.uk
    *****************************************************************
     lastfm feed - Copyright (C) 2013  Bradley Walden

    *****************************************************************

    To use this script you need to include this file using php.
    You can then call the functions.

    lastfmfeed('username','number_of_tracks')
```


Here is a <a title="lastfm feed php equk" href="https://github.com/equk/lastfm_feed" target="_blank">link to the project</a>

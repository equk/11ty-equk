> [!note]
> Configuration is similar to Hyprland which is documented in a previous post<br> <a href="/2023/09/08/switching-to-wayland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switching to Wayland - September 8, 2023</a>

## Why Change

I was getting some stability problems on one of my systems where the system would hardlock with no way of recovering.<br>
Sometimes the system locked up with graphical corruption on the screen.

Switching to sway didn't fix the problem I was having but with sway the system didn't completely lock up which allowed me to debug the problem.<br>
I also never had the graphical corruption I was experiencing on hyprland.

## Main Apps

| Application | Description |
| -- | -- |
| sway | Tiling Wayland compositor and replacement for the i3 window manager |
| alacritty | a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator |
| wofi | a launcher for wlroots based wayland compositors |
| grim | Screenshot utility for Wayland |
| swaylock | Screen locker for Wayland |
| fnott | Keyboard driven and lightweight Wayland notification daemon |
| wl-clipboard | Command-line copy/paste utilities for Wayland |

## Configuration

### Monitors

I have 2 monitors & have odd numbered workspaces on the left monitor & even numbered workspaces on the right monitor.

```properties
# set workspaces to specific monitor
# DP-2 is left monitor
workspace 1 output DP-2
workspace 2 output DP-3
workspace 3 output DP-2
workspace 4 output DP-3
workspace 5 output DP-2
workspace 6 output DP-3
workspace 7 output DP-2
workspace 8 output DP-3
workspace 9 output DP-2
workspace 10 output DP-3
```

### Mouse Acceleration

```properties
input type:pointer {
  accel_profile "flat"
  pointer_accel -0.5
}
```

### Keyboard Layout

```properties
input type:keyboard {
  xkb_layout us
}
```

### Resize Split

```properties
bindsym $mod+minus resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt
bindsym $mod+plus resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt
```
